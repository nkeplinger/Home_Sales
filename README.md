# Home_Sales Big Data Analysis
Utilizing SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data

## Overview 
A Spark data frame is created from remote dataset `https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.2/22-big-data/home_sales_revised.csv`

Because of the size of the data, temporary DataFrames are created investigating average prices for various home features (e.g., number of bedrooms, bathrooms, sq. footage etc.). [SQL] Queries are performed to return and present requested data and house features. All data requirements can be found in the following Jupyter Notebook `HJome_Sales.ipynb`. 

Thanks,
